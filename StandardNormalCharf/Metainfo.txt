Usage:			r = StandardNormalCharf(t,l)

Input:
't- scalar, complex number indicating the point at which the characteristic function should be calculated'
'l- list, containing l$mu (the expectation) and l$sigma (the standard deviation) of the Standard Normal Distribution'

Output:

r- scalar, complex number representing the value of the characteristic function at t

Example:

Please mind the necessary subroutines.
mu = 0 
sigma = 1 
l = list(mu=mu,sigma=sigma) 
t = compl(1,1) 
StandardNormalCharf(t,l)

Result: Contents of r$re
