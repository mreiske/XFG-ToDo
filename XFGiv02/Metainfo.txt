Description: 'Estimates an implied volatility surface applying the Black and Scholes formula, an iterative algorithm to estimate the implied volatility employing the bisection method, and localized kernel regression using the Nadaraya Watson estimator with bandwidths bw = c(250,0.5) for moneyness and time to maturity for a quartic kernel. A 3D graphical illustration is given.'
