Description: 'Displays first and second eigenvectors of the VDAX index for the ATM implied volatility data (implvola.dat). Taking only the first two factors, the time series of implied ATM volatilities can be represented by a factor model of reduced dimension: x(t,j) = gamma(j,1)*y(t,1) + gamma(j,2)*y(t,2) + epsilon(t). gamma(j) are sensitivities of the implied volatility time series to shocks of the principal components. A shock of the first factor tends to affect all maturities in a similar way, causing a non-parallel shift of the term structure. A shock of the second factor, on the other hand, has a strong negative impact on the front maturity but a positive impact on the longer ones, thus causing a change of curvature in the term structure of implied volatilities.'
