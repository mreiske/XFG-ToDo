Input: 't: scalar, complex number indicating the point at which the characteristic function should be calculated. l: list, containing l$mu (the expectation) and l$sigma (the standard deviation) of the Standard Normal Distribution.'

Output: 'r: scalar, complex number representing the value of the characteristic function at t'

Example: 'Please mind the necessary subroutines. mu = 0 sigma = 1 l = list(mu=mu,sigma=sigma) t = compl(1,1) r= StandardNormalCharf(t,l).
          Result: Contents of r$re [1,] 0.5403. Contents of r$im [1,] -0.84147.'
