Input: 'n: number of samples to use in the plot N: modulus of the FFT to use in the approximation, should be a power of 2 dt: the size of the grid in the approximation of the Fourier inversion integral.'

Output: 'Plots the 1%-quantile from the two one-parametric sub-families of the class of quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors, as defined by the functions XFGdg11par and XFGdg12par.'

Example: 'XFGqDGtest(n,N,dt): Plots the 1%-quantile from the two one-parametric sub-families of the class of quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors, as defined by the functions XFGdg11par.'
