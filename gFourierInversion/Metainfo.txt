Input: 'N: scalar, the modulus of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) used; should be a power of 2.
K: scalar, the number of evaluations of the characteristic function; K has to be smaller or equal to N; when K < N, the input vector is filled with zeros up to N.
dt: scalar, the grid-size in t used for the approximation of the inversion integral
t0: scalar, indicating whether the t-grid includes t = 0 (t0==0) or t = dt/2 (otherwise)
x0: scalar, the starting point of the x-grid
charf: string, the name of the characteristic function
l: list, containing l$mu (the expectation) and l$sigma (the standard deviation) of the characteristic function (charf).'

Output: 'rn x 1- vector containing the density values on the x-grid. The grid is given by x_j = x_0 + j dx, dx = 2 pi/(N dt)'

Example: 'r = gFourierInversion(N,K,dt,t0,x0,charf,l) approximates the standard normal density and plots it. mu = 0 sigma = 1 par = list(mu=mu,sigma=sigma) r = gFourierInversion(N=512,K=512,dt=0.1,t0=0.05,x0=-pi/0.1,charf=StandardNormalCharf,l=par) z = cbind((-pi/0.1+(0:511)*2*pi/(512*0.1)) , r) plot(z, type="l",col="blue3",lwd=2,xlab="X",ylab="Y",xlim=c(-3,3))'
